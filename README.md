# Algorithms

This is just a practice repository for me to practice writing different algorithms in Java.
The ideas for the algorithms implemented here are largely taken from the book "Introduction to Algorithms, 4th edition" written by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.
Some algorithms may also be from elsewhere.

## Run the tests

`./gradlew test`
